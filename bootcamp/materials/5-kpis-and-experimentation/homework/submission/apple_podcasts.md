# APPLE PODCAST KPI AND EXPERIMENTATION
I'm an avid podcast listener -- to the point where I don't have enough time in a day to listen to all the podcasts that I love and subscribe to.
Prioritization can be challenging, these features aim to combat decision fatigue amongst for podcast whales (people who use the app more frequently)
*Experiment 1: Smart Resume - Daily Highlights from Subscribed Podcasts*

Objective: Many users subscribe to podcasts but don’t consistently listen to new episodes. To improve retention and daily engagement, Apple Podcasts introduces a Daily Highlights feature, presenting short 20-second clips from new episodes of already subscribed podcasts. These highlights will be selected from the most engaging moments of each episode, increasing the likelihood of users listening to the full episode.

Null Hypothesis: The Smart Resume Daily Highlights feature does not increase daily podcast engagement or full-episode listens.

Alternative Hypothesis: The Smart Resume Daily Highlights feature increases daily engagement and encourages users to listen to more full episodes.

Leading Metric: Number of users who listen to at least one full episode after engaging with a daily highlight. (A full episode may need to be adjusted to consider intro/outro/ad reads)

Lagging Metric: Increase in total daily listening time across all subscribed podcasts.

Test Cell Allocation:

50% Control Group: Standard experience—users receive no highlights, only full episode notifications.
50% Test Group: Users receive a curated feed of 20-second highlights from their subscribed podcasts.

*Experiment 2: Smart Resume - AI Recaps for Unfinished Episodes*
Objective: Many users abandon podcast episodes partway through and struggle to pick up where they left off, especially after a long gap. Apple Podcasts introduces AI-generated recaps to summarize key points from an unfinished episode when users return after 24+ hours. The goal is to determine if this feature improves episode completion rates.

Null Hypothesis: AI-generated recaps do not improve episode completion rates for unfinished podcasts.

Alternative Hypothesis: AI-generated recaps increase episode completion rates by helping users quickly re-engage with past episodes.

Leading Metric: Percentage of users who resume playback after receiving a recap.

Lagging Metric: Increase in full episode completion rates for users who had previously paused listening for 24+ hours.

Test Cell Allocation: 50%-50%

Control Group (50%): Standard resume experience (starts from last played position).
Test Group (50%): AI-generated text + audio recap appears before resuming playback.


*Experiment 3: “Podcast Rivalry” - Opposing Perspectives for More Engagement*
Objective: Users tend to stay in content bubbles, limiting exposure to differing viewpoints. To encourage engagement, Apple Podcasts introduces the “Podcast Rivalry” feature, pairing episodes with opposing perspectives (e.g., pro-crypto vs. anti-crypto). The goal is to see if this increases click-through and listen-through rates.

Null Hypothesis: The Podcast Rivalry feature does not significantly increase engagement with suggested content.

Alternative Hypothesis: The Podcast Rivalry feature increases click-through rates and encourages users to engage with a broader range of podcasts.

Leading Metric: Percentage of users who engage with at least one opposing viewpoint suggestion.

Lagging Metric: Increase in time spent listening to recommended episodes.

Test Cell Allocation: 50%-50%

Control Group (50%): Standard episode recommendations.
Test Group (50%): Rivalry-based recommendation cards featuring contrasting viewpoints on hot topics.
